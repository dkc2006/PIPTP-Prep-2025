### ✅ **Question (Problem Statement)**
For how many times will the while loop be executed?

### 🧠 **Pseudo Code**

```
1. Integer a
2. Set a = 1
3. while(a < 5)
4.     a = a + 2
5. end while
6. Print a
```

🔁 Dry Run of the While Loop:
   Initialization:
   a = 1

### First Iteration:
Condition: `a < 5 → 1 < 5` ✅

`a = a + 2 → a = 3`

### Second Iteration:
Condition: `a < 5 → 3 < 5` ✅

`a = a + 2 → a = 5`

### Third Iteration:
Condition: `a < 5 → 5 < 5` ❌

**Loop stops**

✅ Conclusion:

`Loop run 2 times`
